# BasicProxy

Very basic inefficient reverse proxy for Angular app that's hosted on Google Cloud Storage

If a path doesn't have a . in it, then a HEAD request is made to check if the path is not a 404.
If the path is a 404 the proxy returns the index.html of the proxy URL (to allow angular routing to work)
